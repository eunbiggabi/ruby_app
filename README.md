### Development, Purpose & Scope

Purpose: **Typing game** is a fun educational word-typing game to be played in a command-line interface. The goal of **typing game** is to provide a fun way of practice your typing.

Problem: Within the older group, there was no correlation between the total time spent on the entire task and the number of corrections, but increased typing speed was related to more errors. The results suggest that the approach to the task was different across age groups, either because of age or because of cohort effects. We discuss the interplay of speed and accuracy with regard to digital writing, and its implications for the design of human-computer interactions

Target Audience: **Typing game** is an excellent game for everyone. Created for entertainment purpose, but it can be beneficial, especially in educational purpose such as younger and elderly people.

Target Audience Usage: **Typing game** will be launched from the command line using the files listed in the installation section of this README.md document.
